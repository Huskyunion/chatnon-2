        <p>You might be wondering what happened to Chatnon! July 25th, was this website's one year anniversary. To celebrate, this entire website will be rewritten from the ground up to be better and more exciting! Feedback is crucial, so if there is anything that bothers you, please yell at me.</p>
        <p>The rewrite will span multiple months and it will take a while for Chatnon to get back where it was. Check back soon, there will be updates everyday.</p>
        <p>This entire project is open sourced on <a href="https://github.com/brandonhuang/chatnon-2">Github</a>.</p>
